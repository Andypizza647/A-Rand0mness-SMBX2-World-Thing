extrasounds.lua (v0.3.0)
by Spencer Everly

To install, place every file (Except this readme) into the root of an episode, and then require it using luna.lua by using this:

_G.extrasounds = require("extrasounds")

extrasounds should activate right away.

See the lua file for more information, along with some settings to tweak as well.
